# NMSC_Final_Project
Final Project of Numerical Methods in Scientific Computing

NMSC_Final_Project.pdf contains all details about the final project.

The program was divided into four different files in order to keep the program organized. 


`nuclear_stopping_equations.py`: The equations used to numerically calculate the nuclear stopping power
`nuclear_stopping_formula.py`:   Equations used to calculate the universal nuclear stopping power
`math_libary.py`:                Other cumbersome math used in the program
`main.py`:                       Combines the results and does plotting
